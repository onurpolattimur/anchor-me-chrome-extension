# Anchor Me ⚓︎

You can add anchor tag wherever you want and jump to this anchor whenever you want.

It is really annoying finding where you have stopped in a long document when you wanted to check previous pages. With Anchor Me you can place an anchor on any point you want and reach those points easily.
