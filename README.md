# Anchor Me ⚓︎

You can add anchor tag wherever you want and jump to this anchor whenever you want.

It is really annoying finding where you have stopped in a long document when you wanted to check previous pages. With Anchor Me you can place an anchor on any point you want and reach those points easily.

You can install Anchor Me extension from  [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/anchor-me/bojogamcfbnkplnlijknhmcgijamfioc?hl=en).
